# MPEG-DASH-client-example
This is a very basic example of an MPEG-DASH client. <br/>
Don't forget to hit play.<br/>
It downloads MPEG segments one by one and changes the video quality in function of your internet connection.<br/>
The current quality is written as the page title.
	
You can see the client in action here:
