    This is a very basic example of an MPEG-DASH client. <br/>
	Don't forget to hit play. (scroll down) <br/>
	It downloads MPEG segments one by one and changes the video quality in function of your internet connection.<br/>
	The current quality is written as the page title.
	<video id="vivi" controls autoplay width=1280>Video element not supported</video>
